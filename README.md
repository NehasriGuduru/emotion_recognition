TITLE:
Emotion Recognition from Speech Audio Project 

Description

This is one of the emotion recognition models through spoken sentences using audio data. Make use of deep learning techniques and speech processing techniques in order to classify different categories of emotional recordings into distinct categories. Applications: In mental health monitoring, in human-computer interactions, and in automated customer care systems.

Technologies used


Primary: Python is where the modeling takes place; data is also being processed there, and learning happens from using many machine learning algorithms.

Librosa: this is a Python library, though in this exercise, I used it more to load audio files. It was also used, however, for audio or musical features from audio files like MFCC and visualization of waveforms.

Matplotlib: A plotting library for Python that enables visualizing the data. For this project, it has been applied to display waveforms from audio files that can facilitate understanding of audio signals in the process.

NumPy: It is the most fundamental package in Python, which provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a group of mathematical functions to work on these arrays.

Pandas: A data manipulation and analysis library. This is used to manipulate datasets, especially for loading and processing audio file metadata and labels.

Scikit-learn: It is the Python machine learning library, providing many tools beside various algorithms that can be used for preprocessing data for developing a classification model.

Deep Learning Frameworks (for example, TensorFlow or PyTorch): Depending on the implementation, either TensorFlow or PyTorch could be used for building and training deep learning models in emotion classification from audio features.

Audio File Formats: The project will involve multiple audio file formats (such as MP3, WAV) for the training of the model. The selected audio format must be compatible with the audio processing libraries used.

Process Overview
Data Collection: You will need to collect a set of audio files with corresponding emotion labels. You can use publicly available datasets, such as RAVDESS or other emotion-annotated speech datasets.

Data Preprocessing:

Import audio files using Librosa.
Convert audio signals into numerical representations suitable for training models (e.g. extract MFCCs)
Organize the data in a structured format, Pandas DataFrame, with corresponding file paths and emotion labels.
Data Visualization:

Visualize waveforms of audio files of different emotions
Feature Extraction: Selective features are extracted from an audio signal that feeds into a model. Features predominantly employed are:
MFCCs
Chroma Feature
Spectral Contrast
Training:
Dataset splitting
Choose and avail a suitable ML or DL model. 
The features extracted would then be used to train the model using the proper labels.
Model Evaluation: Measure how well the model performed based on its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score in the testing set.

Deployment: The validated model may then be included in real-time applications that can use the emotions detected or be further analyzed for insights in the patterns of emotional changes.

Future Work: Improvement can be achieved through increasing data, looking at transfer learning techniques, or even combining the model with text or other visual data for richer emotion recognition.
